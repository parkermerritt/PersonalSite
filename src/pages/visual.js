            </header>
            <p>
              Becoming a graphic designer was never part of my planâ€” in high
              school, I inadvertently signed up for yearbook class under the guise
            of a "Research" block. Four years later, I was the editor-in-chief,{' '}
              armed with design skills honed during many meticulous hours of
              Adobe-fueled creativity. These skills were useful in shaping the
              brands of my own business ventures, as well as the many businesses I
              partnered with in doing freelance graphics and video work.

                  As an experienced videographer with a knack for storytelling, in 2019 I was tapped
                  by IBM management to create a promotional video for the presitigious Summit training
                  program. As the project's chief director, editor, and interviewer, I spoke to a number of
                  fellow IBMers about their early career experiences, weaving their remarks together into a single, cohesive narrative.

                  In September of 2018 I partnered with blockchain-based Virtual

                  University of Florida's Reitz Union. In addition to assisting in
                  social media outreach and speaker acquisition, I also created
                  posters and graphics to advertise the event.

                  In 2017 I partnered with photographer Sammy Mercado (

                                                to form a media marketing firm, Mahi Media. Working with
                                                Gainesville bands and small businesses, I worked on film and
                                                graphic design while Sammy focused on photography and digital
                                                media. Together, we created groundbreaking visual content,
                                                discovered great music, and made memories that would last us a
                lifetime.{' '}
